#Breakfast Burritos

**_FOR THE GUACAMOLE_**
 2 ripe avocados
 1 lime juiced
 ½ tsp sea salt
 1 pinch of freshly ground black pepper
 10 cherry tomatoes
 1 tsp ground cumin
 ½ tsp chilli flakes
 1 small bunch of fresh coriander
**_FOR THE MUSHROOMS WITH SPINACH_**
 2 cloves of garlic
 150 g of oyster mushrooms ( or mushrooms of your choice )
 1 tbsp oil
 3 tbsp tamari / soy sauce
 1 handful of fresh baby spinach
**_TO ASSEMBLE_**
 1 x 400g tin of baked beans
 4 wholemeal tortilla wraps

 _Start_ by making the guacamole. Peel and de-stone the avocados and chop the flesh into small pieces. Put into a bowl with the lime juice, salt and black pepper. Chop the cherry tomatoes in half and add along with the cumin and chilli flakes. Mash with a fork until the avocado breaks up and comes together. Finely chop the coriander (including the stalks) and add. Mix, taste and adjust the seasoning if you think it needs it.

_Peel_ and finely chop the garlic and roughly chop the mushrooms. Put the oil into a medium pan on a high heat and leave to heat up. Add the garlic and mushrooms and cook for 1 minute, stirring regularly. Add the tamari and cook for a further 2 minutes. Add the spinach and cook for a further minute, until it wilts right down. Remove from the heat.

_Put_ the baked beans into a pan and heat up on a medium heat, stirring occasionally.

_Now_ it’s time to roll up your breakfast burritos. Lay out one of your wraps, then, in line along the middle of the wrap, spoon on a few tablespoons of beans, some guacamole and some mushrooms, leaving lots of wrap on either side. To roll your burrito, start by folding both ends in, then roll lengthways. Fold the other end of the wrap over or under, while tucking in both ends as you do so. Eat as it is, or put back into the pan for a minute to crisp up the outside. Make the rest of your burritos the same way.

_Enjoy your Breakfast!_
